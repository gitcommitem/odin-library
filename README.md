# TOP Javascript Course Project - Library

01/11/2022 ~ 01/31/2022

## Objectives

Create a simple reading list / library app using objects and object constructors.

- Allow users to add a new book with the following fields:
    - Author
    - Title
    - Number of pages
    - Read status
- Allow users to delete a book from the reading list
- Allow users to change the read status of a book

## Learnings

I am starting to feel a lot more comfortable with working with arrays and objects now. I am also getting better at knowing what kind of logic I need to chain together in order to get the features to work the way I want. This was an interesting project and I hope to revisit it later to add more functionality like the ability to filter for books. At the time of this writing, TOP has updated their course order for the fullstack JS pathway and recommends students pause whereever they are at in the JS course and follow the new course order instead.
